                What lies within is many a goodie. <br>

                One day I may catch a glimpse at the beach <br>
                It resides at home, watching the lone star, <br>
                If I had the hours, I'd certainly visit by car. <br>
                They remind me of a speedy wagon, so strong and formed, <br>
                Perhaps one day it's my arm that is warmed! <br>
                That's all you get, now don't take too long! <br>
