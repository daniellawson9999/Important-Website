					Lookie lookie at my bookie, <br>
					What lies within is many a goodie. <br>
					Guess correctly and be alright, <br>
					but be wrong and face satan's might. <br>
					
					The thing I desire now lies beyond my reach <br>
					One day I may catch a glimpse at the beach <br>
					It resides at home, watching the lone star, <br>
					If I had the hours, I'd certainly visit by car. <br>
					They remind me of a speedy wagon, so strong and formed, <br>
					Perhaps one day it's my arm that is warmed! <br>
					That's all you get, now don't take too long! <br>
					By wasting time, your doom you simply prolong. <br>

					What do I seek?<br>
